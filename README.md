<h3>Enough of all of that, how do you run the app?</h3>

As of now, we do not own a developer account, so the only way to run SleepJournal is to do the following:

<h3>Downloads needed:</h3>
Node.js
Cocoapods
VScode(obviously)
A bunch of npm installs here are a few:

npm install expo-blur

npm install expo-linear-gradient

npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage

npx expo install expo-image-picker

Those are just some of the libraries. There may be more. Be sure to run these by first:
cd SleepJournal
Then you install the libraries 
After you have installed all required libraries, you should be able to run the app with "npx expo run: ios" or android just replace "ios"

Notice you have to create a valid account as there is Firebase integration, and you have to use a VALID email!
